# Tracker API
## What is Tracker?
It's like a CRM, but for your friends. Basically it's a way to make sure you don't accidentally forget to see your friends for an entire year because you got too busy with the day-to-day parts of life.
## Features
- Create friends and keep notes on things like who hates bowling and who likes to go camping, or who was the last person to pay for dinner
- Group friends together based on shared activities, or just who gets along with who
- Set reminders to reach out to friends with push notifications
